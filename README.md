Builds a table of cookies sold per hour based on sales data computed against a randomly generated number of clients on a given day. Uses DOM methods to push data to page rather than rely on HTML.

Styled in CSS with image and paragraph text in the HTML.

Style guide included.

Form asks for user to input additional stores and store data. If selected this we recreate the table
and append new stores.
